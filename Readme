Description:
MotionObjectDetection is a Python script for real-time motion object detection using computer vision techniques. The script captures video frames from a camera, applies background subtraction within a user-defined region of interest (ROI), and identifies moving objects within that region. When motion is detected, the script triggers a beep sound and optionally minimizes specified windows.

Key Features:

Background subtraction using Gaussian blur and morphological operations.
User-defined region of interest (ROI) for targeted motion detection.
Real-time display of video frames with bounding boxes around detected objects.
Beep sound alerts for motion events, customizable duration.
Option to minimize specific windows upon motion detection.
Configuration:
The script reads configuration parameters from a config.json file, allowing users to customize area thresholds, detection duration, beep settings, and window minimization preferences.

Usage:
This script can be used for applications such as security surveillance, motion-triggered alerts, or interactive installations where real-time motion detection is crucial.

Dependencies:

OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy
winsound
pygetwindow
tkinter
How to Use:

Ensure that the camera is connected and accessible.
Create a config.json file with the desired configuration parameters.
Run the script, and press 'q' to stop the detection.
Contributions:
Contributions and improvements to the script are welcome. Feel free to submit pull requests for enhancements or bug fixes.
